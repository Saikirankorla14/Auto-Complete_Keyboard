# Auto-Complete_Keyboard

Auto-Complete Keyboard
📌 Project Goal
Build an auto-complete keyboard that predicts the next word using n-grams and Markov chains.
🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Markov Chains
- N-gram Modeling
📂 Dataset
You can use any large corpus of text such as:
- Wikipedia Dumps
- News articles
- Movie scripts
- Custom datasets
🔍 How It Works

1. Preprocess the text using NLTK: tokenize, clean, and normalize.
2. Create n-grams (bi-grams or tri-grams) to model sequences.
3. Construct a Markov chain model that learns transition probabilities from one word to the next.
4. Given a current word or phrase, use the model to predict the most probable next word(s).

🚀 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

   pip install nltk

2. Load or input your dataset.

3. Preprocess and build the n-gram model.

4. Predict next word(s) based on input.

5. (Optional) Create a simple GUI using Tkinter or Streamlit for interactive typing experience.

📈 Applications

- Messaging apps

- Email clients

- AI writing assistants

- Language modeling experiments

📎 Optional Enhancements

- Add smoothing techniques to handle unseen n-grams

- Integrate neural models for hybrid predictions

- Store frequently used phrases for custom suggestions

- Train on multiple languages and detect language contextually
